## My process


### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

I focused a lot more on Flexbox and how to get things positioned to look right. I still fell like my CSS is a little messy. I am trying to figure out a solid process.

### Continued development

I still have a ton to learn with CSS, but I feel like this is a never-ending process.

### Useful resources

The Internet
